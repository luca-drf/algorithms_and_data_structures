Common Algorithms And Data Structures
=====================================
A small collection of basic algorithms and data structures in C++.

Requirements
------------
- Your favorite C++11 compiler
- GTest 1.7.0 (required for C++ unit tests)
- CMake (optional but recommended)

Build
-----
The recommended way to build this package is with [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).

Example:
    
    % cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
    % make

CMake will create and put the executables in the `bin` directory.

Test
----
In order to build the unit tests, [GTest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) 
is required.
